# TEXT-BASED-MEDICAL-CHATBOT
Designing a chatbot that trains on a predefined data set stored in Json file and responds to all the questions asked by the user using Natural Language Processing Algorithm.
Problem Statement :- Design a chatbot that trains on a predefined data set stored in Json file and responds to all the questions asked by the user using Natural Language Processing Algorithm.

* Design a chatbot that trains on a predefined data set stored in Json file and responds to all the questions asked by the user using Natural Language Processing Algorithm.

Concepts used :
1) NLP (Natural language processing)
2) Json file (java script object notation)

Real time Applications :

Symptom Checker:
Enables users to input symptoms and receive information about potential health conditions, providing initial guidance on their health concerns.

Appointment Scheduling:
Facilitates convenient scheduling of healthcare appointments, streamlining the process for users to access medical services.

Medication Reminders:
Sends timely reminders to users for medication adherence, helping improve treatment compliance and health outcomes.

Health Information and Education:
Provides users with accurate and reliable information about medical conditions, treatments, and preventive measures, promoting health literacy.

Dataset used :
1) The Chatbot will respond based on the predefined user input stored in the json file.
2) When a new question is asked the bot searches for predefined text which is stored in the json file and responds back according to it.

Optimization :
The transformers library is employed to load the pre-trained model and tokenizer. Additionally, a response cache is maintained to improve performance for repeated queries.

This approach leverages the capabilities of a powerful language model to provide more contextually relevant and natural-sounding responses. Keep in mind that using such pre-trained models might have associated costs and API usage limitations depending on the model provider.
